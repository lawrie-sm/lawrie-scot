    Greetings. I'm Lawrie, an Edinburgh-based full stack developer. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I like code which is clean, simple and fast.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work for <a href="https://recast.app">Recast</a>, the sports video marketplace. I mostly use React and Node, though I also maintain an enthusiasm for Go in my spare time.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy exploring new technologies and tweaking my Linux setup. I also cultivate an excessive number of house plants.
